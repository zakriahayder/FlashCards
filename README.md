# Flashcard App

This is a simple flashcard app that helps users create, manage, and review flashcards. It's designed for studying and memorization.

## Features

- Create and manage flashcards with questions and answers.
- Save flashcards to a file for future use.
- Review flashcards in a random order.
- Track your progress while reviewing.

## Object-Oriented Design

The app is built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, making it easier to understand and modify.

- The app uses **classes** to organize code into small, reusable parts.
- **flashcard_app.py** contains classes like `Flashcard` and `FlashcardManager` to handle flashcard creation and management.
- **data_handler.py** handles saving and loading flashcards, keeping data storage separate from other functions.
- **main.py** runs the app and connects everything together.

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: The main file that runs the app and handles user input.
- `flashcard_app.py`: Manages the creation, review, and storage of flashcards.
- `data_handler.py`: Handles saving and loading flashcards from files.
